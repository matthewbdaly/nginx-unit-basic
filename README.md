nginx-unit-basic
----------------

Basic Dockerfile for running [Nginx Unit](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx-unit/) as a Docker container.

I know very little about Docker as this stage, so I fully expect this to only really be useful as a starting point.

You can run it with `docker run -p 8000:8000 -d matthewbdaly/nginx-unit-basic`
